# Changes:
- Fixed playback-exit focus restoration so movie/series flows return focus to content cards more reliably instead of jumping to the close/menu button.
- Mirrored Categories-style series playback behavior across non-Categories surfaces to reduce playback transition regressions.
- Bumped app version to 2.9 and updated release APK naming.
